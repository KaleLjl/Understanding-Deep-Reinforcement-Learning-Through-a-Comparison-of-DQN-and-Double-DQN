## Introduction 
- This is the year3 final individual project by a student at the University of Manchester, majoring in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE).
- The project is an analytical study that compares the performance of Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Double DQN across three distinct simulated environments: Cartpole, Lunar Lander, and Pong. It aims to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of these reinforcement learning algorithms through comprehensive development, tuning, and training processes.
- The project was conducted entirely using Google Colab.
## Project components
The project is divided into three main components:
- Learning.zip: Includes the foundational implementation of both DQN and Double DQN. This code, utilizing PyTorch Lightning, has been instrumental in deepening the understanding of the differences and advantages of each algorithm.
- Tuning.zip: Features the hyperparameter tuning process for DQN and Double DQN, specifically tailored to the Cartpole, Pong, and Lunar Lander environments. This part of the project uses the Raylib library to streamline the implementation and focus on optimizing the hyperparameters.
- Training_Performance.zip: Contains the code necessary to train the agent using the found hyperparameters from Tuning.zip , utilizing the Raylib library.
