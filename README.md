# Introduction
This is an final individual project developed by student in the university of manchester studied in EEE.
These project contains three zip package
- The "learning" zip including the implementation sturcture of both DQN and Double DQN, this code utilized pytorch lightning and have helped me to understand these two algorithms a lot.
- The "Tuning" zip including the hyperparameter finding process of DQN and Double DQN throughout " Cartpole,Pong,Lunarlander environment respectively. The code utilized rillib libraiy to easier implement the algorithms and focus on the hyper-parameters finding
- The "
